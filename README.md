# Boston Housing Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis

The code performs multivariate linear regression analysis on the Boston Housing dataset. It explores the dataset, handles missing values, normalizes selected columns, and splits the data into training and testing sets. Using gradient descent, it implements a linear regression model to predict housing prices (MEDV) based on the number of rooms (RM). The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) on the test set.

## Topics:

- Dataset Loading and Exploration
- Handling Missing Values
- Data Normalization using Min-Max Normalization
- Dataset Splitting for Training and Testing
- Multivariate Linear Regression Hypothesis Function
- Gradient Descent Implementation
- Visualization of Regression Line on Scatter Plot
- Model Evaluation with MSE and MAE
## Note:

- The code is well-commented, making it easy to understand each step.
- Min-max normalization is applied to selected columns for feature scaling.
- Gradient descent is used to optimize the model parameters for regression.
- Visualization aids in understanding the relationship between features and target variable.
- Evaluation metrics provide insights into the accuracy of the regression model.
